Stream Visualizer is an application that can be used to visualize, capture and replay data streams.

Currently, Stream Visualizer can work with data received from files (including pipes), standard input, YARP ports and ROS topics. For more information on YARP, see http://eris.liralab.it/yarpdoc/index.html. For more information on ROS, see http://ros.org.

To get going, read the InstallationInstructions and GettingStarted wiki pages.
