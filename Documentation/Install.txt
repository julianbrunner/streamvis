#summary Installation Instructions

= Linux =

== Prerequisites ==

Stream Visualizer needs the mono runtime in order to run. To build it, you'll also need the mono development tools and xbuild. In order to do a checkout from the repository, you'll need subversion.

If you're running Ubuntu 10.04 Desktop, you'll need to have the packages `subversion mono-devel mono-xbuild` installed to follow these instructions.

== Instructions ==

  # (Optional) Install YARP (http://eris.liralab.it/yarpdoc/install.html)
  # (Optional) Install ROS (http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Installation)
  # Do one of the following
    * Do a checkout of the SVN repository: `svn co http://streamvis.googlecode.com/svn/tags/Version\ 1.3 streamvis`
    * Download a source package provided in the downloads section on Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/streamvis/downloads/list)
  # Run `make` inside your working copy

== Wrap-up ==

The Stream Visualizer binaries along with the wrapper libraries will be created in the `Binaries` directory of your working copy.

*Note:* If YARP and/or ROS are not available, the make command of the respective wrapper libraries will fail, but it will not abort the build process so that people who don't want to use these interfaces can still build Stream Visualizer. If you do want to use YARP and/or ROS, you may want to check if they built correctly.

= Mac OS X =

I don't have a machine to test this on, though it should be somewhat similar to what needs to be done to get it running on Linux.

If anyone has done it on Mac OS X, I'd appreciate some feedback on how to set it up.
