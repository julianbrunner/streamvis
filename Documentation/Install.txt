Linux
----------

   1. (Optional) Install YARP (http://eris.liralab.it/yarpdoc/install.html)
   2. Install MonoDevelop 2.0 (or newer) (http://monodevelop.com/Download)
   3. Do a checkout of the trunk of the SVN repository on Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/streamvis/source/checkout) or download and extract one of the SVN snapshots provided in the downloads section on Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/streamvis/downloads/list)
   4. Open Source/Visualizer.sln in MonoDevelop and build either the project Visualizer or the entire solution 

The Stream Visualizer binary will be created at Source/Visualizer/bin/<configuration>/streamvis. It needs Source/Visualizer/bin/<configuration>/libYarp.Wrapper.so to run.

Windows
----------

   1. (Optional) Install YARP (http://eris.liralab.it/yarpdoc/install.html)
   2. Do a checkout of the trunk of the SVN repository on Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/streamvis/source/checkout) or download and extract one of the SVN snapshots provided in the downloads section on Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/streamvis/downloads/list)
   3. Open Source/Visualizer.sln in the C# IDE of your choice
   4. Remove the reference to Yarp.Wrapper from the project Yarp
   5. Build either the project Visualizer or the entire solution
   6. Download the most recent version of the Yarp.Wrapper Windows Binaries from the downloads section on Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/streamvis/downloads/list)
   7. Extract the version of Yarp.Wrapper that corresponds to your system (x86 or x64) from the downloaded zip file to a directory where Windows searches for library files 

You can launch Stream Visualizer by executing Visualizer.exe in the Stream Visualizer target directory. It needs Yarp.Wrapper to run.

Mac OS X
----------

I don't have a machine to test this on, though it should be somewhat similar to what needs to be done to get it running on Linux.

If anyone has done it on Mac OS X, I'd appreciate some feedback on how to set it up.
