TODO: Rename Graphics to Graphics2D
TODO: Find a better name for Extensions
TODO: Search for leftover floats
TODO: Check namespace-folder mapping
TODO:	Enforce strict conventions on naming and content of Extension method classes (i.e. only extension methods that extend
		the class after which the extension method class is named can go in there)

TODO: Find reason for stop'n'go on Windows (maybe it's the same as on Linux?)
TODO: Test the stop'n'go issue on Ingo's PC
TODO: Test difference between Debug and Release builds on different machines

TODO: Resampling can be parametrized, specify either as samples/pixel or samples/second
TODO: Caching should take place on multiple level (i.e. resampling, minimum/maximum finding, graph transformations, maybe even rendered graphs)
TODO: Check for correctness of pipeline (i.e. examine the output on manual data insertion)
TODO: Use Range<Time> or other instances of Range<T> where appropriate

TODO: Profile the new wrapper
TODO: Memory profiling?
TODO: Complete logging of all received data
TODO: Change design so that containers and ports are 1:1, in order to avoid excessive locks and duplicate data in memory

TODO: Make sure the 0.5 pixel offset is handled correctly everywhere (after doing various improvements to the drawing procedure)
TODO: Make lines thin when no antialiasing is possible
TODO: Text on Linux is blurry

TODO: Make Layouter adaptive to width of the Y-Axis labels
TODO: Better parameter error checking (values of 0 shouldn't be allowed for interval counts, etc.)

TODO: Hide OpenTK members sufficiently so that a reference to Graphics doesn't result in a dependency reference to OpenTK

TODO: Test if all plotter types still work as expected
TODO: Remove unused usings and references
TODO: Make classes internal which don't have to be public
TODO: Look for places to use LINQ queries

TODO: Remove reference to Yarp in Visualizer once monodevelop does proper file copying on dependency resolution
TODO: Remove symbolic link to libYarp.Wrapper in Yarp once monodevelop does proper file copying on dependeny resolution
TODO: Extension methods don't work without reference to System.Core?!
